# School_District_Analysis

##Overview of the school district analysis: 
- The purpose of this analysis is to replace some scores for the 9th graders at Thomas High School.  It was believed that the scores were dishonest and needed to be removed in order to uphold the state testing standards.  Once removed we were tasked with re-runnin the analysis for the PySchools to see what the differences were. 

##Results: 
- The district summary and the school summaries have removed the 9th grade students from Thomas High School which decreased the number of students from the calculations.  The removal of these students did not have much of an affect on the district analysis because the sample size is much larger and we removed only about 1 percent of the sample.  The school summary was affected more because the size was greater relative to the school vs the district. 

##Summary: 
- After removing the problem scores the overall sample size changed for the district report.  The same can be said for the district analysis as well.  The over all percentages for reading and math were also affected by the problem scores.
